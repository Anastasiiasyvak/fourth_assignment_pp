Create a CLI which will allow user to enter the input path to an object they want to encrypt or
decrypt. We want our program to work in two modes:
1. Normal mode. This mode is used to test our application. User should be able to encrypt or
decrypt the input file with specified key. This mode allows user to do the following steps:
a. user choses type of operation: encrypt or decrypt
b. user enters input file path
c. user enters output file path
d. user enters the key (in order to encrypt/decrypt the message)
2. Secret mode. For this mode user can only encrypt file and the key should be generated
randomly. This mode allows user to do the following steps:
a. user enters input file path
b. user enters output file path
